# Code of Conduct

All contributors, maintainers, and participants in the eslint-plugin-vue-modular project are expected to behave professionally and respectfully.

## Our Standards

We expect everyone to:

- Be respectful and civil in all communications.
- Assume good faith and give others the benefit of the doubt.
- Focus feedback on code and behavior, not on people.
- Respect diverse perspectives and experiences.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:

- Harassment, intimidation, or aggressive language.
- Derogatory comments regarding race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or any protected characteristic.
- Persistent or unwanted contact, including stalking or offensive messages.
- Public shaming, doxxing, or threats.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it as soon as possible. Provide as much detail as you can (who, when, where, what happened). Reports will be treated seriously and handled promptly and confidentially.

Preferred reporting methods:

- Open an issue in this repository titled "Code of Conduct report" and mark it as private if your platform supports it.

If you need confidential support or are concerned about retaliation, indicate that in your report and we will ensure appropriate confidentiality.

## Enforcement

Maintainers will review reports and take action as appropriate. Possible actions include:

- A private discussion with the person(s) involved
- Temporary or permanent removal of contributor privileges
- Moderation or removal of problematic content

Decisions may be escalated to repository owners or organization administrators when necessary.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces â€” issue trackers, pull requests, mailing lists, chat channels, social media, and in-person events sponsored by the project.

## A Note on Good Faith

We understand people make mistakes. When possible, we prefer education and constructive feedback. However, severe or repeated violations will result in stronger action.
